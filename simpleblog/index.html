        <h1>Sample Phish Lyrics!!!</h1>
        <p>My friend my friend, A clever ruse,
          Woman walks the streets like she's queen
           of the town. Arrows in the tablecloth,
            And that's what keeps me on the ground
            and memory. </p>

        <h1>Phish at Madison Square Garden
          NYE 2016.</h1>
          <h3>by Marcos Esquandolas</h3>
          <p>Set the gearshift for the high gear
            of your soul, The stars in the sky are
            very bright, Lost my mind just a couple
             of times (mmmmmmmiiiiiiiind) Set the
             gearshift for the high gear of your
             soul, But now I need a place to hide
              (pride) That my feet tread upon,
              the moist green organic, Lost my mind
              just a couple of times
              (mmmmmmmiiiiiiiind) I wish somebody'd
              hear me, </p>
